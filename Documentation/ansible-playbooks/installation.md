# Installation

StackHead uses Ansible to install the required software and connect to the servers. If you have your own Ansible workflow you may also directly use the StackHead collection.

The collection is available on Ansible Galaxy: [getstackhead/stackhead](https://galaxy.ansible.com/getstackhead/stackhead).

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install getstackhead.stackhead
```

It can also be installed from the official Git repository.

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/getstackhead/stackhead.git
```
